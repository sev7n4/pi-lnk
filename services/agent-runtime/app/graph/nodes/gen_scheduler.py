"""Generation scheduler: the single arbiter that fans out gen_node via Send.

Why a central scheduler (not per-node fan-out):
  - Diamond dependencies (C depends on A,B; A,B run in parallel) deadlock under
    per-node fan-out: A completes, sees B not done, doesn't dispatch C; B
    completes, doesn't know A finished, doesn't dispatch C either. A central
    scheduler reads the FULL accumulated state (merged by reducers after all
    parallel gen_node of a superstep finish) and is the only thing that decides
    what to dispatch next — so it always sees both A and B done.

Why no in-flight / dispatched tracking:
  - LangGraph Pregel batches all ``Send`` targets in one ``Command(goto=[...])``
    into a single superstep; they ALL complete (results merged via reducer)
    before the ``gen_node → gen_scheduler`` edge re-triggers the scheduler. So
    "in-flight" is always 0 when the scheduler runs — concurrency is simply
    ``ready[:max_concurrency]`` per superstep. ``completed/failed/needs_user``
    already prevent re-dispatch, so no separate dispatched-set is needed.

Termination: when nothing is ready to dispatch, every remaining unprocessed key
has been cascade-marked failed/needs_user by the forward topo pass, so all keys
are processed → ``goto collect_gen``.
