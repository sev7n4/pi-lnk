# Enterprise marketing campaign

## Instructions

1. Clarify product category, sales channel, and placement (e.g. Tmall detail page, brand site hero).
2. Draft a structured marketing plan in Markdown: positioning, copy blocks, and visual asset list.
3. Ask the user to confirm or revise before splitting the canvas.

## Split and image generation

- Follow `assets/canvas-manifest.yaml` when splitting the canvas.
- Product chain: white_bg → product_turnaround (4-panel) → downstream images; model chain: portrait → turnaround → lifestyle.
- Three videos: video_product / video_scene / video_lifestyle; voiceover/subtitles only in prompt hints (no TTS/mux yet).
- Do not call `run_image_generation` during plan; only after user「确认出图」→ orchestrate_gen.
- Scheme confirm writes the plan node; topology preview (Mermaid + skeleton) comes before image gen.
- `topology_mode_default` (`full`|`trimmed`) may be overridden by the user.

## Progressive disclosure

- Keep this file concise; put long brand rules in `references/`.
- See `assets/examples/sanitary-ware.md` for a sanitary-ware campaign outline.
